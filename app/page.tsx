			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p className="not-prose">
				I have been harbouring the aspiration to return to the IT field, 
				aiming to continue the career I had built over three years in Brazil as a low-code developer. 
				During my time in Brazil, I actively contributed to a significant project with a small team, 
				which afforded me substantial responsibilities and rapid learning opportunities.
				I took a hiatus in my career to embark on my first international journey, 
				seeking new avenues for personal and professional growth.
			</p>
			<p>
				Upon arriving in New Zealand with limited English proficiency, I accepted the first job opportunity I encountered, 
				working diligently to achieve urgent personal goals. Today, having successfully fulfilled my short-term objectives, 
				I feel ready to resume my professional development plan. Along this journey, 
				I have significantly enhanced my communication skills and now possess the confidence to pursue a role 
				where English proficiency is a requirement.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am a free-spirited individual with a thirst for knowledge, 
				finding joy in studying and engaging my mind with puzzles and challenges. 
				Currently, I possess solid technical knowledge in application development, 
				SQL, algorithms, flowcharts, programming logic, application versioning, and systems modelling. 
				I am eager to deepen my expertise in specific languages such as React, Vue, JavaScript, SQL, PHP, HTML, and CSS. 
				I am open to exploring new technologies and expanding my knowledge into different areas of study.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to my technical skills, I am willing to delve into various fields of human knowledge purely for leisure, 
				including philosophy, music, psychology, astronomy, physics, mathematics, biology, history, politics, and cultural aspects.
			</p>
			<p>
					I a'm currently holding a valid work visa until June 2024 and am actively seeking sponsorship opportunities. 
					I am enthusiastic about the prospect of contributing my skills and 
					dedication to' your team and look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can add value to your organisation.
